# Function

## use keyword `function fun_name(){ }` //definition
- fun_name      //It just simply says, function is present there
- fun_name()    //function call

If I doesn't specify return anything, It says `undefined`
If I doesn't pass any argument inside a function, It says `undefined` not `null`

### NOTE:
- undefined is marked as `false`
- blank is also marked as `false`
