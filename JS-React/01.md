we have to import 2 files under the index.js 
- `React` --> core foundational library that takes the references 
- and `React-DOM` --> React implementation on WEB {same as React-Native is React implementation on mobile apps}



use `Vite` or `Parcel` to create React app.

- To create a app : `npm create vite@latest`
- `npm install` OR `npm i` --> add node modules, as Vite doesnt create
- `npm run dev`

Note: inside the Vitem JS is loaded directly (no script dependency)


# react-script(package.json) is responsible for the binding of index.js(src) to the main html(public) file
- To see the scripts : go to browser and see `page source`
- inspect to see further scripts inside the body of html  



manifest.json : mainly handles the mobile devices rendering. how the website looks like
